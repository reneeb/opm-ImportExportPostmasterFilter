ImportExportPostmasterFilter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You might have two OTRS instances and you want to copy all or a single Postmaster Filter from one
instance to the other. Currently there is no safe way but copying the filters manually.

This add on inserts a new widget in the AdminPostMasterFilter pages that allows the admin to import
or export filters.

The export on the filter overview create a JSON file with all filters. If you need to export a single
filter, go to the edit page an click on "Export".

For the import you can define whether existing filters (with the same name) should be overridden or not.
